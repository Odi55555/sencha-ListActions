sencha-ListActions
==================

This is a plugin that adds the ability to easily execute actions on multiple
items in a list.  The behavior is modelled after the iOS mail application's
"edit" function.

While this plugin is working and fully usable, it is a work in progress, so
things will change and some stuff might not work properly.  If you find a bug,
open an issue and I'll try to fix it--or even better, submit a patch or pull
request.

Usage
-----

For more documentation, check the actual plugin file, but basic usage is
simple.  You can add this plugin to an existing list by doing the following:

    plugins: [{
        xclass: 'Ext.ux.plugin.ListActions'
    }]

To see all configuration options, take a look at the source as it is mostly
documented.
