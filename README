sencha-ListActions
==================

This is a plugin that adds the ability to easily execute actions on multiple
items in a list.  The behavior is modeled after the iOS mail application's
"edit" function.

While this plugin is working and fully usable, it is a work in progress, so
things will change and some stuff might not work properly.  If you find a bug,
open an issue and I'll try to fix it--or even better, submit a patch or pull
request.

Usage
-----

For more documentation, check the actual plugin file, but basic usage is
simple.  You can add this plugin to an existing list by doing the following:

    plugins: [{
        xclass: 'Ext.ux.plugin.ListActions'
    }]

To see all configuration options, take a look at the source as it is mostly
documented.

You'll also need to add some CSS.  Look at the source code in app/index.html
for an example.  By default the 'check2' icon is used when an item is selected,
which is not included by default.  In order to get the check mark to display, you
need to edit your sass style sheet and add ``@include pictos-iconmask('check2');``.
